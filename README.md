## Summary

During the pandemic, I watched many people receive thousands of dollars in donations for essentially being themselves. The donees had shelter, food, water, and clothing to say the least. The goal of QRCodes2ComeHome is to enable the less fortunate with the means to accept digital transactions in a cost-effective manner with little to no cost on behalf of the homeless. 

If a person becomes homeless they are immediately cut off from the basic services they need to recover. The ability to apply for jobs, receive benefits, open a bank account, receive post: all are placed out of reach at the point they are needed most. Those who might have otherwise got back on their feet with a little early support are instead left to become entrenched in the situation and develop more complex and care-intensive needs over time.

While there are shelters, I personally have witnessed dozens of homeless on street corners or at the end of a bridge holding a piece of cardboard with cries for help such as "Need Help", "Down on their Luck", or "Will work for food". QRCodes2ComeHome believes in the intrisic good of humanity, in granting the chance to make a change for the better, and having a real impact on the everyday world you experience. This charity is not "I’m donating money in another country and running in circles to feel like I’ve done something to feel and aid the suffering of others in a place I'll never know and to people I'll never meet. This is, "I saw a human in need, and I reached out right then and there to make a knowable diffence in their life in my community. I gave them hope today for a brighter future tomorrow."

This document summarizes QRCodes2ComeHome. The charity is fundamentally comprised of a physical address, a cell phone, a reloadable debit card, and a PayPal account. By demonstrating how a person can setup a paypal account at a library using this charity's address and donated phone number, a QR code can be printed to accept donations for change. Donors can then scan the QR code to make instant donations to the individual by simply pointing their phone's camera at the code and choosing their means of payment. The donee recipient would then transfer the donation to the reloadable card to pay for the goods and services of daily living (food, clothing, shelter). 

Ultimately, the aim is to create a website which will provide social services to the homeless, log short and long term goals, provide instant feedback on the use of the donation to the donor through notifications, create a record of immutable transactions, and provide cards and accounts that are not reliant on PayPal or reloadable Visa debit cards. For the time being, QRCodes2ComeHome will focus on the fundamentals for a proof-of-concept and minimum-viable-product.

## Features
### Feature
Air (example)

### Description
The Air section allows users to connect their airline information, including
flight, airport, and reservation details, into the software with a single link of the confirmation number. With this data, the app will send notifications, flight changes, check-in reminders, and other information.

### Purpose
This prevents users missing important information and will help get the most from their vacation time as possible.

### User Problem
Users have a specific amount of vacation time. They don’t want to spend it sitting in the airport. This allows them to book events and activities as soon as they arrive and up until the last moment.

### User Value
User will simply add their flight confirmation number and the app will have all of the data needed to help.

### Assumptions
Users will likely acquire a ticket from a major airline.

### Not doing
Some smaller regional airlines may not be included. Scope this to see what travel databases and airlines may need to be excluded.

### Acceptance criteria
Connects with the top 10 carriers into California
