# Product Requirements Document
## Summary
This document summarizes the Explore California Initiative. This initiative is designed to create a web application and partnered mobile app to allow people planning a vacation to California an easier, more robust, and better travel experience.

The application will encompass a database containing all California businesses and their relationships to their location, services provided, and the tourism industry. In addition, API connections to various popular review and travel sites will be connected to the core database.

Users will enter all their planning information for their vacation. Aspects of their trip including date, location, interests, and key destinations will help define and narrow the criteria they see. The application will use their profile data to accelerate access to important decision-making data and allow the experience of visiting the state easier and more enjoyable.

Users will be able to book, reserve, and purchase through an underlying commerce site. This will consolidate their experience visiting California and provide a great travelogue of the experience. Functionality on the web application will be mirrored in the mobile app with an emphasis on performance.

This document aims to identify the key features of the application and app to ensure each of these are delivered at launch.

## Features
### Feature
Air (example)

### Description
The Air section allows users to connect their airline information, including
flight, airport, and reservation details, into the software with a single link of the confirmation number. With this data, the app will send notifications, flight changes, check-in reminders, and other information.

### Purpose
This prevents users missing important information and will help get the most from their vacation time as possible.

### User Problem
Users have a specific amount of vacation time. They donâ€™t want to spend it sitting in the airport. This allows them to book events and activities as soon as they arrive and up until the last moment.

### User Value
User will simply add their flight confirmation number and the app will have all of the data needed to help.

### Assumptions
Users will likely acquire a ticket from a major airline.

### Not doing
Some smaller regional airlines may not be included. Scope this to see what travel databases and airlines may need to be excluded.

### Acceptance criteria
Connects with the top 10 carriers into California
